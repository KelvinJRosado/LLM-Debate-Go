# LLM-Debate-Go

A project where I can practice Golang. I'm using this as a learning opportunity for both Golang and Ollama.

The idea for this project is to have 2 LLM "instances" debate each other. There will be a topic, and each instance will be assigned a persona as one side. They will then debate their sides
